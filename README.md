## Plugins

### Modular Session Key Plugin

Originally contributed by [@sm-stack](https://github.com/sm-stack) and Decipher in [this PR](https://github.com/erc6900/reference-implementation/pull/22) to the reference implementation.

The modular session key plugin makes use of the permissions capabilities of ERC-6900 to show how access controls may be implemented over secondary signing keys.
